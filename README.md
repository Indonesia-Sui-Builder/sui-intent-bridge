# Bidirectional Cross-Chain Intent Bridge (Sui ↔ EVM) 🚀

This repository implements a fully functional, bidirectional cross-chain intent bridge between **Sui (Move)** and **EVM (Solidity)**, powered by **Wormhole** for global settlement and featuring a **Dutch Auction** mechanism for optimal price discovery.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Bidirectional**: Move koin seamlessly between Sui Testnet and Base Sepolia (EVM).
- **Intent-Based Architecture**: Users lock funds on the source chain with a "intent", and solvers fulfill them on the target chain immediately.
- **Dutch Auction**: Order prices decay linearly over time, ensuring orders are filled by the most efficient solver.
- **Modular Solvers**: Dedicated bots for each direction with automatic profitability checking and VAA fetching.
- **Fast Execution**: Solvers provide immediate liquidity, while settlement happens asynchronously via Wormhole.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1.  **Intent Creation**: User locks funds in a contract (Sui or EVM (Base Sepolia)) and defines a Dutch Auction (start price, floor price, duration).
2.  **Solver Detection**: Bot monitors events on the source chain and calculates the current required output based on the auction timer.
3.  **Fulfillment**: If profitable, the bot sends the required funds directly to the user's recipient address on the target chain.
4.  **Global Settlement**: The bot fetches a signed VAA from Wormhole as proof of payment and uses it to claim the user's locked funds on the source chain.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Bun (optional, but recommended)
- Sui CLI & Foundry (for contract modifications)

### 2. Installation
```bash
npm install
# or
bun install
```

### 3. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root based on the provided examples:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY_EVM=...
PRIVATE_KEY_SUI=...

# Contract IDs (after deployment)
SUI_PACKAGE_ID=...
EVM_INTENT_BRIDGE_ADDRESS=...
SOLVER_STATE_ID=...
```

### 4. Running the Solvers

Open two terminals to run both directions:

**Terminal 1: EVM ➡️ Sui**
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/solvers/solver_evm_to_sui.ts
```

**Terminal 2: Sui ➡️ EVM**
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/solvers/solver_sui_to_evm.ts
```

## 🧪 Testing the Bridge

### From EVM to Sui
1. Update `scripts/create-order.ts` with your desired recipient.
2. Run: `npx ts-node scripts/create-order.ts`
3. Watch the EVM ➡️ Sui solver pick it up and complete the flow!

### From Sui to EVM
1. Update `scripts/create-intent.ts` with your recipient address.
2. Run: `npx ts-node scripts/create-intent.ts`
3. Watch the Sui ➡️ EVM solver detect the intent and send you ETH on Base Sepolia!
